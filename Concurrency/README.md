# Concurrency

This folder contains different examples related to the concurrency and multithreading. This was part of the concurrency assignment for the backend training.

1. **Time Based Scheduler** - This contains a time based scheduler which takes a number of tasks and schedules the task for execution after specified time-interval delay.
2. **Lock Order Deadlock** - There are two files one demonstrate lock-order deadlock using a code example and other one introduces simple lock ordering to avoid the deadlock.
3. **Fair Thread Scheduling** - This implementes a re-entrent lock with custom implementation instead of using directly from threading.RLock but with using a standard mutex lock.
4. **Connection pool** - This is an example of simple lightwait connection pool which is used for the database access.
